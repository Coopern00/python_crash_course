#  You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a string with a different word
#  Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:
#   message = "I really like dogs."
#   message.replace('dog', 'cat')
#  Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C
#  Print each modified line to the screen

filename = 'learning_python.txt'

with open(filename) as file_object:
    lines = file_object.readlines()

for line in lines:
    line = line.rstrip()
    # Replacing the Python word in each line with C
    print(line.replace('Python', 'C'))
