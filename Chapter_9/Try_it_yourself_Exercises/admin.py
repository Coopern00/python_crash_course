#  An administrator is a special kind of user

#  Add an attribute, privileges, that stores a list of strings like "can add post", "can delete post", "can ban user", and so on
#  Write a method called show_privileges() that lists the administratorâ€™s set of privileges
#  Create an instance of Admin, and call your method
