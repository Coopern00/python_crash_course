# Try it yourself 6-11.
#  Make a dictionary called cities
#  Use the names of three cities as keys in your dictionary
#  Create a dictionary of information about each city and include the country that the city is in, its approximate population, and one fact about that city
#  The keys for each cityâ€™s dictionary should be something like country, population, and fact
#  Print the name of each city and all of the information you have stored about it
