# Try it yourself 2-8.
#  Write addition, substraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8
#  Be sure to enclose your operations in 'print()' calls to see the results
#  You should create four lines that look like this:
#   print(5+3)
#  Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once each line 

print(5 + 3)
print(10 - 2)
print(4 * 2)
print(64 / 8)
