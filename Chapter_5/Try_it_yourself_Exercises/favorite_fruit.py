# Try it yourself 5-7.
#  Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list
#  Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits
#  Write five if statements
#  Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list
#  If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as "You really like bananas!"
