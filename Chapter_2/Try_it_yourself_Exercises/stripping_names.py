# Try it out yourself 2-7.
#  Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespaces characters at the beginning and end of the name
#  Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n" at least once
#  Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed
#  Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, 'lsstrip()', 'rstrip()', 'strip()'
