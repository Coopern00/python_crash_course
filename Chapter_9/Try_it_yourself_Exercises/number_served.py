#  Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0
#  Create an instance called restaurant from this class
#  Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again
#  Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that have been served
#  Call this method with a new number and print the value again
#  Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served
#  Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business
