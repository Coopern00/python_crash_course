# Try it yourself 8-7.
#  Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary describing a music album
#  The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information
#  Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums
#  Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the album information correctly
#  Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of songs on an album
#  If the calling line includes a value for the number of songs, add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary
#  Make at least one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album

# Making a function that takes two paramaters, and an optional one
