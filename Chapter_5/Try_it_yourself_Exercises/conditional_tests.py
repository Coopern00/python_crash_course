# Radovan Novakovity
# Try it yourself 5-1.
#  Write a series of conditional tests
#  Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test
#  Your code should look something like this:
#   car = 'subaru'
#   print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
#   print(car == 'subaru')
#   print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.") 
#   print(car == 'audi')
#  Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False
#  Create at least three tests

# Test 1
pizza = 'pepperoni'
print("Is pizza == 'pepperoni'? I predict True.")
print(pizza == 'pepperoni')

print("\nIs pizza == 'hawaiian'? I predict False.")
print(pizza == 'hawaiian')
print("\n")

# Test 2
car = 'suzuki'
print("Is car == 'suzuki'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'suzuki')

print("\nIs car == 'chevrolet'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'chevrolet')
print("\n")

# Test 3
plant = 'bush'
print("Is plant == 'bush'? I predict True.")
print(plant == 'bush')

print("\nIs plant == 'shark'? I predict Flase.")
print(plant == 'shark')
