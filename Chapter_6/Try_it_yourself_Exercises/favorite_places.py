# Try it yourself 6-9.
#  Make a dictionary called favorite_places
#  Think of three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person
#  To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places
#  Loop through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places

favorite_places = {
    'alex': ['texas', 'ohio'],

# Looping through the dictionary to display everyones name, and favorite place(s)
