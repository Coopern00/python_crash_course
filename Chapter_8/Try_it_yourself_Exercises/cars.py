# Try it yourself 8-14.
#  Write a function that stores information about a car in a dictionary
#  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name
#  It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments
#  Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature
#  Your function should work for a call like this one
#   car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue', tow_package=True)
#  Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly
